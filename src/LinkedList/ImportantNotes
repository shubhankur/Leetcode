Tricks and Algorithms to Solve LinkedLists problems.
1. Two Pointer:-
    i. We can make a fast and slow pointer and find mid of the linked list and
divide the linked list in two parts
    ii. Using a fast and slow pointer we can solve cyclic problems(Floyd cycle algorithm)
    iii.  We can keep the pointers separated by n distance to reach to a node nth place from the end.

2. Recursion:-
    i. Most of the linked list problems can be solved easily by recursion where we have to just identify the base
case

3. Collection:-
    i. We can use Map or List to keep a collection of visited nodes
